### Project Description
This project delivers a single-page web application designed to display a summary of sales data. It fetches `data.csv` from the same directory, calculates the sum of its sales column, and prominently displays the total on a responsive, modern user interface. The page title is dynamically set based on a provided seed value.

### Features
*   **Data Fetching**: Asynchronously loads `data.csv` from the server.
*   **Sales Summation**: Parses the CSV content and sums all numeric values found, treating them as sales figures.
*   **Dynamic Title**: Sets the document title to `Sales Summary ${seed}`.
*   **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap 5 for a mobile-first, fully responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
*   **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, professional design with a clear hierarchy and pleasant aesthetics, using a professional color scheme and typography.
*   **Self-Contained**: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are embedded within a single `index.html` file, making it easy to deploy.
*   **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for network issues or unparseable data.

### How to Use
1.  **Save the Code**: Save the provided HTML code as `index.html`.
2.  **Provide Data**: Create a file named `data.csv` in the *same directory* as `index.html`.
    *   **`data.csv` Format Assumption**: Given the constraint of `3 bytes` for `data.csv` and the requirement to sum its "sales column", the script assumes `data.csv` contains numeric sales figures, one per line, without a header. For example:
        
        100
        
        or
        
        50
        
        (followed by a newline character to make it 3 bytes, if applicable for the system's byte counting)
        The script is robust enough to handle leading/trailing whitespace and empty lines.
3.  **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` with any modern web browser.
4.  The page will automatically fetch `data.csv`, calculate the total sales, and display it. Any errors during fetching or parsing will be shown on the page.

### Technologies Used
*   **HTML5**: For semantic page structure.
*   **CSS3**: For custom styling and modern aesthetics, embedded directly in the `<style>` tag.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For data fetching, parsing, calculation, and dynamic content updates, embedded directly in the `<script>` tag.
*   **Bootstrap 5**: Loaded from the `jsdelivr` CDN for a responsive, component-based styling framework.
